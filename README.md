# SMTP_Relay_Phisher

## Overview
SMTP Relay Phisher is a tool for testing and exploiting the "SMTP Open Relay" vulnerability by simulating real-world phishing attacks. 
This tool used for two purposes:

1. To run the phishing campaign by command line 
2. To exploit the SMTP Open Relay vulnerability by sending phishing email

This tool used custom SMTP-cli. I have done some basic modifications in his script.
Thanks to [smtp-cli](https://github.com/mludvig/smtp-cli) for developing such a useful tool.
